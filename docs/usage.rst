Usage
=====

Welcome to the ultimate Python project template. 
The goal of this usage page is to show you how to
update this template for your needs. 

Step 1: TODO or not TODO
------------------------

As soon as you create a repo using this template,
you're going to want to address all of the TODO
messages around the repo. I recommend starting with
the ``setup.py`` file. There, you can specify the 
name of your project, among other things such as 
your name and email address.
