Usage
=====

Welcome to the ultimate Python project template. 
The goal of this usage page is to show you how to
update this template for your needs. 

Step 1: TODO or not TODO
------------------------

As soon as you create a repo using this template,
you're going to want to address all of the TODO
messages around the repo. I recommend starting with
the ``setup.py`` file in the root directory. There, 
you can specify the name of your project, among other 
things such as your name and email address. 

Once you've updated the ``setup.py`` file, make your
way over to ``conf.py`` file in the docs directory. 
There you'll find a handful of fields to update as well.

That should take care of all the TODOs!

Step 2: File/Folder Renaming
----------------------------

With the TODOs out of the way, the next step is to 
rename the appropriate files and folders. For example,
you'll want to rename the package folder to the name
of your project. Be sure to do this using a refactor
tool of your favorite IDE. Otherwise, you'll have to
chase references to the old name all around the repo. 

Once you've renamed the package folder, go ahead and
rename the module file to whatever you like. It's
fine to give it the same name as the package folder. 

Finally, you'll want to update these names in the
documentation. As a result, head over to the docs
directory and rename the ``package.rst`` file to 
the name of your project. Inside this file, make
sure automodule has the right package and module
names. Then, head to ``index.rst`` and change 
the name of the package reference under the table
of contents.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you run into any problems with this project template,
check out some of these example projects that use a
similar directory structure:
