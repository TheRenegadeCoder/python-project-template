Usage
=====

Welcome to the ultimate Python project template. 
The goal of this usage page is to show you how to
update this template for your needs. 

Step 1: TODO or not TODO
------------------------

As soon as you create a repo using this template,
you're going to want to address all of the TODO
messages around the repo. I recommend starting with
the ``setup.py`` file in the root directory. There, 
you can specify the name of your project, among other 
things such as your name and email address. 

Once you've updated the ``setup.py`` file, make your
way over to ``conf.py`` file in the docs directory. 
There you'll find a handful of fields to update as well.

That should take care of all the TODOs!
