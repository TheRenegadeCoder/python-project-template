Welcome to the Ultimate Python Project Template!
================================================

The Python project template is a repo designed to 
help folks kick off a project with best practices in mind
from the very start. The goal of this documentation is to
provide an example of how you might use this template as well 
as an example of how you might write your own documentation.
